                            <h2>What is the census?</h2>

                            <p>The census is a survey that happens every 10 years and gives us a picture of all the people and households in England and Wales. The next census takes place on Sunday 21 March 2021.</p>

                            <p>Your answers to the census questions will help organisations make decisions on planning and funding public services in your area, including transport, education and healthcare.</p>

                            <h2>When to complete your census</h2>

                            <p>All households should complete the census on <strong>Sunday 21 March 2021</strong> or as soon as possible after. If youâ€™ve responded before 21 March and things have changed, you can <a href="{{pageInfo.rootPath}}/contact-us">contact us</a> to let us know.</p>

                            <p>The census should take around 10 minutes per person to fill in.</p>

                            <h2>The census in Northern Ireland and Scotland</h2>

                            <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) runs the census in England and Wales.</p>

                            <p>If you live in Northern Ireland, visit the <a href="https://census.gov.uk/ni/">Northern Ireland Statistics Agency (NISRA) census website</a> to find out how to take part in the census for Northern Ireland.</p>

                            <p>If you live in Scotland, visit the <a href="https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/2021">National Records of Scotland census website</a> to find out how to take part in the census for Scotland.</p>

                            <h2>The last census</h2>

                            <p>The last census took place in 2011. Many people and organisations used information from the 2011 Census in a variety of ways.</p>

                            <p>For example, Bristol Borough Council used it to inform decisions on how to fund local housing improvements. It was also essential for the charity Redbridge Council for Voluntary Services to help people from ethnic minority groups learn more about dementia.</p>

                            <p>To read more about the benefits that information from the 2011 Census helped to create, visit the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census">Office for National Statistics (ONS) website</a>.</p>
