                            <p>The census is a survey that happens every 10 years and gives us a picture of all the people and households in England and Wales. The next census takes place on Sunday 21 March 2021.</p>

                            <p>Your answers to the census questions will help organisations plan and fund public services in your area, including transport, education and healthcare.</p>

                            <h2>When to complete your census</h2>
                            
                            <p>All households should complete the census on <strong>Sunday 21 March 2021</strong> or as soon as possible after. If youâ€™ve responded before 21 March and things have changed, you can <a href="../contact-us">contact us</a> to let us know.</p>

                            <p>The census should take around 10 minutes per person to fill in.</p>
