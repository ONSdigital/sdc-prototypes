            <h2>Why students should take part in the census</h2>

            <p>The information you give in the census informs funding decisions on things like university campus bus links and bike lanes, jobs and training. It also helps to decide how to plan and fund public services such as healthcare and education. By taking part, you can make sure the student community gets the services it needs now and in the future.</p>

                <p>The census is a survey that happens every 10 years and gives us a picture of all the people and households in England and Wales.</p>
                <p>The next census is happening on Sunday 21 March 2021 and we want to make it as easy as possible for students to take part.</p>
