                            <p>At the Office for National Statistics (ONS), we will be carrying out the census for England and Wales in March 2021.</p>

                            <p>We’ve created an address register to make sure that every household and managed accommodation in England and Wales gets a census questionnaire.</p>

                            <p>We will send you a letter by post containing the access code needed to fill in your census questionnaire online.</p>

                            <p>We will never call you for information about your census, unless you’ve made an appointment with our Contact Centre.</p>

                            <p>We will never ask you for your national insurance number, passwords, bank account details, or your credit or debit card numbers.</p>

                            <p>Any emails from us will be sent from <strong>census.2021@notifications.service.gov.uk</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Any texts you receive from us will be sent from <strong>Census2021</strong>. If you text us, our responses will come from <strong>86677</strong>.</p>

                            <h2>Our census field staff may visit you</h2>

                            <p>Census field staff may visit to offer help if haven't completed your census. They may also visit to make sure that everyone has been counted. They will identify themselves as being from the ONS and carry an official ID badge displaying their photo and unique reference number.</p>

                            <p>We carry out employment checks to make sure that everyone working on the census is qualified to work with the public.</p>
