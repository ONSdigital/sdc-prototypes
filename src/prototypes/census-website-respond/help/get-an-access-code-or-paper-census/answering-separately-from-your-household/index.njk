                            <p>Your individual answers will take priority over any information submitted about you in the household census.</p>

                            <p>You can choose to receive your new access code by text or post.</p>

                            <p>If you choose to receive your access code by text, we will need your mobile number for this. This will not be stored and only used once to send the access code. The text will be sent from <strong>Census2021</strong>.</p>

                            <p>If you choose to receive your access code by post, a letter with your individual access code will arrive in a unbranded envelope. The letter can be addressed to you, but we can only send access codes to the registered household address.</p>
