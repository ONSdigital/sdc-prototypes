                            <p>If someone is living in a property, they must be counted in the census. Taking part in the census helps give local services the information they need to support you and your community.</p>

                            <p>The owner or the squatter can complete the census for the property. Whether or not you open the letter, someone must fill in a census form for this property. Not completing the census risks prosecution, a criminal record and a fine of up to £1,000.</p>

                            <h2>I’m the owner</h2>

                            <p>When you receive the census letter, complete the form for the address.</p>

                            <p>If you can’t get the post from the property, you can complete the census online by <a href="/help/get-an-access-code-or-paper-census">requesting an access code</a> to be sent to you by text.</p>

                            <p>If you don’t know who’s living there, you still need to answer a few of the questions.</p>

                            <h3>I’m filling in an online form</h3>

                            <p>Answer the questions about the accommodation. Also answer the questions about who lives here, using “Person 1” and “Person 2” for the names.</p>

                            <p>When completing the online form you will have the opportunity to order individual forms for those living in the property. The forms will be sent to the property by post.</p>

                            <h3>I’m filling in a paper form</h3>

                            <p>Answer questions H7 to H13 about the accommodation only.</p>

                            <h2>I’m squatting</h2>

                            <p>If you’re living or staying here, you should complete the census. Your answers are protected by law and are kept confidential.</p>

                            <p>If we don’t receive a completed census for this address, a census officer will call at your door. To make sure this doesn’t happen, return or submit your completed census form as soon as you can.</p>
