            <h2>Why students should take part in the census</h2>

            <p>The information you give in the census informs funding decisions on things like university campus bus links and bike lanes, jobs and training. It also helps to decide where billions of pounds of public money are spent on services such as transport, healthcare and education.</p>

            <p>Without the census, it would be more difficult to make these decisions. That’s why it’s so important everyone takes part and that you make sure you’re counted.</p>

                                <p>As a student, you must answer the census for your term-time address if you stay there most of the time. This is the case whether you’re a student living in halls, a shared house or flat, or you’re an international student.</p>

                                <p>You should do this even if you’re on term-time holidays or a reading week when you complete the questionnaire.</p>

                                <p>If you have a separate home address in England or Wales, your family needs to include you on their household questionnaire too.</p>

                                <p>They will not need to answer all the individual questions about you. You should complete these questions on the form about your term-time address.</p>

                                <h3>Not at your term-time address?</h3>

                                <p>If you are not at your term-time address at the time of the census and are unable to collect your letter, you will need to <a href="#">request a new access code</a>.</p>
