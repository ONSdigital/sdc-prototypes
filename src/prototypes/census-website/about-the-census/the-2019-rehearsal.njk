    <p>We’re holding a 2019 Rehearsal to make sure the process for Census 2021 works. We have chosen four areas to take part in the rehearsal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Carlisle</li>
        <li>Ceredigion</li>
        <li>Hackney</li>
        <li>Tower Hamlets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We've been testing parts of our system for the last three years and have made changes based on what we’ve learned. Now we're rehearsing the whole census process. Technology has changed a lot since the 2011 Census, which is why we need a rehearsal.</p>

    <p>Testing our processes will help us make sure Census 2021 is easier to do and better for everyone. We can only do this if people take part in the rehearsal. You do not have to but if you’re invited, we’d be grateful if you take part.</p> 
    
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about taking part, please <a href="/prototypes/census-website/contact/">contact us.</a></p>
