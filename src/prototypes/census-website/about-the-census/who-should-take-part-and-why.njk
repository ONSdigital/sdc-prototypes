    <p>We ask everyone living in England and Wales for information about where they live and who they live with.</p>
    <p>The information and data we get from the census helps the government spend public money. It does this by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>giving us detailed information we can't get from anywhere else</li>
        <li>including everyone in the country at the same time</li>
        <li>showing if people are being treated fairly and have the same access to help and services</li>
        <li>showing where we need things like hospital beds, doctorsâ€™ surgeries, schools, new roads and investment in jobs</li>
