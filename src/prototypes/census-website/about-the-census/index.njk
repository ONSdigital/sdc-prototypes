    <p>The census is a count of all the people and housing in England and Wales, run by the Office for National Statistics. Itâ€™s happened every 10 years since 1801, except during World War 2 in 1941. This balances the difficulty of running a census and getting the information we need. </p> 
    <p>A separate census for Scotland is run by <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/censusq">National Records for Scotland</a>.</p>
