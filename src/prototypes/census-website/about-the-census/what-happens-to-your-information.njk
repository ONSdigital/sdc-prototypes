    <p>Different organisations use information from the census for planning and policy making. For example, the data is used by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>central government to share out public money between councils</li>
        <li>councils and government departments to make plans and policies</li>
        <li>charities to find out where there are people who need extra help</li>
        <li>companies to plan where to build shops and businesses</li>
        <li>researchers and academics to understand current and future changes in our society</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are working on ways we might be able to replace the census in the future, by using information from other sources, like government departments.</p>
