                                    <li><strong>owns outright:</strong> This is if you own your accommodation without a mortgage or loan. You should also select this if you’ve paid off your mortgage but have made an arrangement with the lender to continue to pay a small amount in return for them looking after the deeds.</li>
                                    <li><strong>part- owns and part- rents (shared ownership):</strong> This is if you own part of your accommodation and also pay rent for part of it. You can part- own your property with or without a mortgage or loan.</li>
                                    <li><strong> rents (with or without housing benefit):</strong> This is if you pay rent to a landlord to live in this property. Select this if you pay your rent yourself or if your rent is paid from housing benefit or universal credit.</li>
                                    </ul>

You should still select this response if you don’t pay rent but do make a contribution towards household expenses. Some examples of rent-free living include:</p>

                                    <li>someone paying no rent and living in thhe property of a deceased partner which is held in trust</li>
                                    <li>someone paying no rent who is divorced/separated and living in a property which is owned solely by their ex-partner who no longer lives there</li>

                                    <p>Do not select this if your rent is paid by housing benefit. Choose <strong>Rents (with or without housing benefit)</strong> instead.</p>

                                   <p><strong>Own your home with a lease:</strong> Select either <strong>Owns outright</strong> or <strong>Owns with a mortgage or loan</strong> depending on your circumstances. Whether or not you pay ground rent isn’t relevant to this question.</p>
