    <p>Fill out the census for the address where you will be on the 13 October 2019.</p>

    <p>If you are the householder and have not received a census letter, <a href="/prototypes/census-website/contact">contact&nbsp;us.</a></p>
    <p>If you are not the householder, you will need the unique access code to complete your individual questions. Check with the householder to see if they have the census letter with the unique access code.</p>
    <p>This may not be possible, or you may not want the people you live with to see your answers. You can <a href="https://sdc-prototypes.netlify.com/prototypes/rh-census/address.html">request a code to respond separately</a>. We will send you a new access code by text.</p>
