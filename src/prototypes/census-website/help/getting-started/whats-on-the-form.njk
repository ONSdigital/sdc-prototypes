    <p>The <strong>household</strong> form has three sets of questions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Household questions about the home you live in</li> 
        <li>Individual questions about each person who lives here</li>
        <li>Visitor questions about anyone staying overnight on 13 October 2019</li> 
    </ol>
    <p>The <strong>individual</strong> form is personal. It only has questions about one person. <a href="#">You can order this form</a> if you want to keep your answers private from the rest of the household.</p>
    <h2>Can I fill in a personal form?</h2>
    <h3>If you’re aged 16 or over</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can. A personal form lets you keep your information private from the other members of your household.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Order a personal form here</a></p>
    <p>You can request a personal form even if your household form has already been filled in. We won’t tell the householder that a form has been ordered. Your request and your answers are confidential.</p>
    <h3>If you’re aged 15 or under</h3>
    <p>Questions about you should be completed by a householder.</p>
    <h2>How many people can I fit on a form?</h2>
    <p><strong>Online form:</strong> As many as you need.</p>
    <p><strong>Paper form:</strong> Up to five people. If there are more people in your household, you can do it online or order a continuation form.</p>
