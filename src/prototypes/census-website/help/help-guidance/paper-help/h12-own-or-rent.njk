                                    <li><strong>part- owns and part- rents (shared ownership):</strong> This is if you own part of your accommodation and also pay rent for part of it. You can part- own your property with or without a mortgage or loan.</li>
                                    <li><strong> rents (with or without housing benefit):</strong> This is if you pay rent to a landlord to live in this property. Select this if you pay your rent yourself or if your rent is paid from housing benefit or universal credit.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <li>someone paying no rent who is divorced/separated and living in a property which is owned solely by their ex-partner who no longer lives there</li>

                                    <p>Do not select this if your rent is paid by housing benefit. Choose <strong>Rents (with or without housing benefit)</strong> instead.</p>

                                   <p><strong>Own your home with a lease:</strong> Select either <strong>Owns outright</strong> or <strong>Owns with a mortgage or loan</strong> depending on your circumstances.
