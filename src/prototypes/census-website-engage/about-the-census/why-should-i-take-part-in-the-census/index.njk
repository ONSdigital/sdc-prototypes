                            <p>It’s important you take part in the census. The information it gives has the power to make a real impact on our day-to-day lives.</p>

                            <h2>The census is vital to all of us</h2>

                            <p>The census helps us understand what our society needs now and what it will likely need in the future. The information it collects helps with decisions on the planning and funding of services in your area. This could include schools, doctors’ surgeries, emergency services or even local support groups.</p>

                            <p>Charities also use census information to help get the funding they need. Businesses use it to decide where to set up, which creates job opportunities.</p>

                            <p>You can read more about how the <a href="#0">Mental Health Foundation</a> and <a href="#0">London Fire Brigade</a> use census data to support and protect communities.</p>

                            <h2>Its success could help you</h2>

                            <p>A successful census in 2021 will help give the best picture of the needs of everyone living in England and Wales.</p>

                            <p>A total of 94% of people responded to the last census, helping each area receive its share of public funding. Without the census, it would be much more difficult to provide your area with the services you need.</p>

                            <h2>You must complete the census by law</h2>

                            <p>It is an offence to supply false information or to not complete the census, and you could be fined up to £1,000. Some questions are clearly labelled as voluntary. It is not an offence if you do not answer these.</p>
