                            <p>The census happens only once every 10 years and gives us the most accurate estimate of all the households in Northern Ireland. There’s nothing else that gives as much information about us, our society and future needs.</p>

                            <p>By filling out the census questionnaire, you help build a picture of all of us which helps decide how services are planned and funded in your local area. This could mean things like doctors’ surgeries, housing or new bus routes.</p>

                            <p>The safety of your information is our top priority. You will be able to read our privacy statement before completing your census questionnaire. When we publish the statistics from the census they are completely anonymous, so none of your personal information is shared or published.</p>

                            <p>We have a strict security regime that follows government standards. This includes physical and IT security measures to protect your data.</p>

                            <p>All our systems, staff and suppliers and how we process things must protect your confidentiality by law. Laws in place that cover protection of your data include the:</p>
