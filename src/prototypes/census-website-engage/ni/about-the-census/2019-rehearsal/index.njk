                            <p>Thank you to all who took part in the 2019 census rehearsal.</p>

                            <h2>Why we held a rehearsal</h2>

                            <p>The census aims to count everyone in Northern Ireland, which makes it a pretty big task. No other survey gives us as much information about us and our society.</p>
                            
                            <p>We ran a rehearsal to help us make sure our processes, systems and services are running smoothly. The rehearsal took place in October 2019. It was a practice run so we get things right for the real thing.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Where the rehearsal took place</h2>

                            <p>We chose three particular areas as together they represent a good cross section of our society. The three locations included urban, rural and mixed areas with varying internet coverage, places where there are non-English speakers, students and residents of a variety of backgrounds and ethnicities.</p> 
                            
                            <p>We asked people in the three areas of Northern Ireland to fill in the census rehearsal questionnaire. The areas were:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>South &amp; East Belfast</li>
                                <li>Craigavon</li>
                                <li>West Fermanagh</li>
