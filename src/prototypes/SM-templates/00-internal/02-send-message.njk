This gives us an indication of how many businesses are available for selection - the greater number of similar sized businesses there are, the fewer ONS needs to select to ensure the results we produce are representative of the industry. \r\rThe rotation period for the Monthly Wages and Salaries Survey is usually 60 months but this is not a guarantee. It can fluctuate depending on a number of factors i.e the number of businesses available in the cell, movement between cells, how many new businesses are generated and how many cease to trade. Consequently ONS cannot give a definitive period of selection for this survey. \r\rWe do appreciate that, for some businesses, completing our surveys can be a particularly onerous task especially when the resources available to do so are limited; however, the demand for high quality statistics which inform Government's monetary and economic policies is continually increasing. Unfortunately, without some imposition on the business community ONS would be unable to undertake its work and, for now, the surveys are considered to be the most practical means of obtaining the information needed.";

If we were to grant exemption to a business, selection for our surveys could no longer be declared as fair and it could lead to potential bias in the survey samples and hence, the results based on them. Therefore, failure to comply can result in legal proceedings being instigated. \r\rPlease let me assure you that ONS sampling procedures are designed to be fair and no business is singled out to complete our questionnaires. Selection for ONS business surveys is based on the principle that businesses of a similar size, and within the same industry, have the same probability of being selected. All the samples for our surveys are selected independently which is why a business can be selected for more than one survey at a time, be reselected for a particular survey at some point in time, or equally may find itself not selected at all.
